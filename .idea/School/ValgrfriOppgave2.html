  <h1><strong>About EPS</strong></h1>
  <h2>European Project Semester</h2>
  <p><strong>European Project Semester (EPS) is a programme offered by
    several European universities to students who have completed at least
    two years of study. EPS is created with engineering students in mind,
    but other students who can participate in an engineering project are
    also welcome.</strong></p>

    based learning. It is crafted to address the design requirements of the degree

    of today’s world economy. Students work in international and interdisciplinary
    teams of 3–6 students on their projects. Projects are done in cooperation with
    commercial businesses and industries or with research centers. There are minor
